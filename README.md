This project came in useful during the cross country trip to New Mexico.

My teammates used this app daily to add items to a firebase database that we use to store the data so it can be seen across all devices.

I used the safari add to screen feature to make this web app look more like an app on the iphone.

working on this app I learned a lot about fetching and transfering data to the database and how we can use object keys to remove items from the database using a "onclick event"

I sharpend my flexbox skills a bit more to align the items the way I want and we used meta viewport to make the app not shrink when shown on a mobile device.

AI was used to design a nice Icon for our app which was then put on favicon for proper sizing.

I learned how I can fetch functions from different javascript files and even from other sources which allowed me to fetch a lot of the functions needed for firebase using the import from.
